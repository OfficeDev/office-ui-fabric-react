      "comment": "If ScrollablePane content-container has a horizontal overflow only when a sticky component is in non-sticky state, when this component becomes sticky, it is no more inside content-container in the DOM, so the horizontal scrollbar won't be available. Note: In this case, sticky component will still have horizontal overflow but there would be no horizontal scrollbar. Keeping a non-sticky placeHolder width equal to Min(nonStickyContent.scrollWidth when the component is non-sticky state, nonStickyContent.scrollWidth when the component is in sticky state) for best experience.",
