      "comment": "In order for webpack 4 tree shaking to work, all cross package imports must refer to non-path based imports, so that webpack can refer to the `module` entrypoint of the package, rather than whatever type is in path (if you refer to a `/lib/` path, it would infer commonjs, wich breaks tree shaking.) With this change, you can now `import { PrimaryButton } from 'office-ui-fabric-react'` and get a properly shaken tree of modules, resulting in smaller output.",
