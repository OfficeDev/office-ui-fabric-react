##### Lists components for Office UI Fabric React

These are not production-ready components and **should never be used in product**. This space is useful for testing new components whose APIs might change before final release.

To import Lists components:

```js
import { ComponentName } from '@uifabric/lists';
```

Once the Lists component graduates to a production release, the component will be available at:

```js
import { ComponentName } from 'office-ui-fabric-react';
```
