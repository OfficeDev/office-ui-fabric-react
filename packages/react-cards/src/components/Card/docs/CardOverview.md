A Card is a surface to display content and actions about a single topic. It acts as a container for actionable information like text, images and icons.

A Card abstracts styling properties to utilize them in tandem with theme variables and provides some inherent styling in the way of a box-shadow on the container.

**_Note:_** _This component is not importable from the `office-ui-fabric-react` package. It can be imported, however, from the `@uifabric/react-cards` package._
