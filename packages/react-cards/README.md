##### ReactCards components for Office UI Fabric React

These are not production ready components and __should never be used in product__. This ReactCards space is useful for testing new components whose APIs might change before final release.

To import ReactCards components:

```js
import { ComponentName } from '@uifabric/react-cards';
```

Once the ReactCards component graduates to a production release, the component will be available at:

```js
import { ComponentName } from 'office-ui-fabric-react';
```
