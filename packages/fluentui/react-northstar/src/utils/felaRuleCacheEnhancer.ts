/**
 * Updates fela's `renderRule` method to compute classNames on a more granular
 * level: by property rather than by style object.
 *
 * Rather than generating a full className for an entire style object at once,
 * it now walks the style object and generates classes for each individual
 * property.  This allows us to avoid reprocessing styles that should already
 * be cached.
 *
 * NOTE: this approach does not work for monolithic classNames, since that
 * treats an entire style object as a single entity. So, do not use this if
 * you are using that mode.
 *
 * Before:
 * Rule -> Style -> Process -> Classes -> Cache -> Return Classes
 *
 * After:
 * Rule -> Style -> Iterate Properties -> Return Classes
 *                         |
 *                   Property Cached?
 *                            Yes -> Return Classes
 *                            No  -> Process -> Classes -> Cache -> Return Classes
 *
 * TODO: We should seperate fela plugins into two categories:
 *
 * 1. Contextual (relies on theme RTL, disableAnimations, etc.)
 * 2. Normal (no reliance on environment).
 *
 * With this approach, we can always run contextual plugins before
 * checking the cache. This would reduce coupling between the cache
 * and other fela plugins, since it would then just have to check
 * simple key: value pairs.
 *
 * Fela would need to be updated ("enhanced") in some way to support
 * this plugin split.
 *
 * After V2:
 * Rule -> Style -> Contextual Plugins -> Iterate Properties -> Return Classes
 *                                            |
 *                                      Property Cached?
 *                                               Yes -> Return Classes
 *                                               No  -> Process -> Classes -> Cache -> Return Classes
 *
 * Further, if we can make the context stable (i.e., not include `displayName`
 * for each component) then we can _also_ cache by context. e.g.:
 *
 * const cache = new WeakMap<Context, Cache>
 *
 * TODO: can we share anything with fela's internal cache?
 * TODO: possible to share ltr/rtl caches?
 * TODO: hook into .clear() to clear our cache as well?
 * TODO: cache expiry? Retain MRU? Ignore (like fela)?
