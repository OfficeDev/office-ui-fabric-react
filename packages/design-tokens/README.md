# Design Tokens

This package contains Fluent UI design tokens for the web.

This package will eventually derive its tokens from the [Fluent UI Token Pipeline](https://github.com/microsoft/fluentui-token-pipeline).
At the time of writing, the pipeline is not consumable so this package was stubbed using pipeline output.

See "Design Token Architecture" in Figma for more.
