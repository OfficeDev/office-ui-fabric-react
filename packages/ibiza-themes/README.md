##### IbizaThemes components for Office UI Fabric React

These are not production ready components and __should never be used in product__. This IbizaThemes space is useful for testing new components whose APIs might change before final release.

To import IbizaThemes components:

```js
import { ComponentName } from '@uifabric/@uifabric&#x2F;ibiza-themes';
```

Once the IbizaThemes component graduates to a production release, the component will be available at:

```js
import { ComponentName } from 'office-ui-fabric-react';
```
