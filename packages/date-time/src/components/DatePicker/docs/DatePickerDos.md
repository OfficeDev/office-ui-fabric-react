- Do use the control as a single entity.
- Do set the default date to the current date unless a specific date is required for context (e.g. the date of the conference).
- Do allow the DatePicker to resize relative to available screen width.
- Do if allowing for manual entry of date, provide helper text in the appropriate format. The control renders date in a specific format.
