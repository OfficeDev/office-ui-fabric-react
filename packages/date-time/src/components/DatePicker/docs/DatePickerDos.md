- Do use the control as a single entity.
- Do set the default date to the current date unless a specific date is required for context (e.g. the date of the conference).
- Do allow DatePicker to render in either wide or narrow. The control is designed to resize relative to available screen width.
- Do make sure you have at least 300px of width for the DatePicker when it renders as a flyout.
