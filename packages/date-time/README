# [Office UI Fabric React DateTime](http://dev.microsoft.com/fabric)

##### DateTime components for Office UI Fabric React

These are not production ready components and __should never be used in product__. This DateTime space is useful for testing new components whose APIs might change before final release.

To import DateTime components:

```js
import { ComponentName } from '@uifabric/date-time';
```

Once the DateTime component graduates to a production release, the component will be available at:

```js
import { ComponentName } from 'office-ui-fabric-react';
```
