- Use Button labels that have a clear purpose. Labels should describe the action of the button in a single line and include a concise verb. If their is room for interpretation about what the verb operates on, a noun should also be used.
- Consider the effect localization will have on the button and what will happen to components around it.
- Consider how the button will resize if the buttonâ€™s label content is dynamic.
- Use only a single line of text in the label of the button.
- Show only one primary button that inherits theme color at rest state. In the event there are more than two buttons with equal priority, all buttons should have neutral backgrounds.
- Ensure that Default buttons always perform safe operations. For example, a default button should never delete.
- Use task buttons to cause actions that complete a task or cause a transitional task.
