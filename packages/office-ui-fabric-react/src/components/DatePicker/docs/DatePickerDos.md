- Use the control as a single entity.
- Set the default date to the current date unless a specific date is required for context (e.g. the date of the conference).
- Allow Calendar to render in either wide or narrow. The control is designed to resize relative to available screen width.
- When the control is engaged, the Calendar renders as a flyout and has defined widths (300px -narrow and 440px â€“ wide). Plan your UI implementation accordingly.
- If allowing for manual entry of date, provide helper text in the appropriate format. The control renders date in a specific format.
