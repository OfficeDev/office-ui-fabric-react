- Don't attempt to break apart year from month/day selectors. If granularity is required, use the Dropdown control or something similar.
- Don't attempt to force resize the control in any way.
- Don't force the control to render one mode vs. the other (year or month/day.)
- Don't modify flyout selector's behavior in any way. The flyout selector is a light dismiss control.
