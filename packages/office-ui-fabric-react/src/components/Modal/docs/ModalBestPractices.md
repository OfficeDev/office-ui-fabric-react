### Layout

- Use a variable width with a minimum width of 288 pixels.
- Use a variable height with a minimum height of 172 pixels.
- Center vertically and horizontally in the available space.
- Always have at least one focusable element inside a modal.
- When possible, try a non-blocking modal before resorting to a blocking modal.
- Provide a clear way for people to dismiss the control, such as a Close button, which should always go in the upper right corner.

### Content

#### Title

- Keep the length as concise as possible.
- Don’t use periods at the end of titles.
- Use sentence-style capitalization—only capitalize the first word. For more info, see [Capitalization](https://docs.microsoft.com/style-guide/capitalization) in the Microsoft Writing Style Guide.

#### Body copy

- Use the body content area for additional info or instructions, if needed. Don't restate the title in the body.
- Body copy should be actionable, with the most important information at the beginning, and should end with a period.

#### Checkbox labels

- Use a sentence fragment for the label, rather than a full sentence.
- Make it easy for people to understand what will happen if they select or clear a check box.
- Don’t use end punctuation (unless the check box label absolutely requires multiple sentences).
- Separate two groups of check boxes with headings rather than positioning them one after the other.
- Use sentence-style capitalization—only capitalize the first word. For more info, see [Capitalization](https://docs.microsoft.com/style-guide/capitalization) in the Microsoft Writing Style Guide.

#### Radio button labels

- Use a phrase for the label, rather than a full sentence.
- Make sure to give people the option to not make a choice. For example, include a “None” option.
- List the options in a logical order, such as most likely to be selected to least, simplest operation to most complex, or least risk to most. Listing options in alphabetical order isn’t recommended because the order will change when the text is localized.
- Select the safest (to prevent loss of data or system access), most secure, and private option as the default. If safety and security aren't factors, select the most likely or convenient option.

#### Button labels

- Be concise. Limit labels to one or two words. Usually a single verb is best. Include a noun if there’s any room.
