A Checkbox is a UI element that allows users to switch between two mutually exclusive options (checked or unchecked) through a single click or tap, but require further action, such as a save or commit, to have effect on the system.

Nest a Checkbox under a control when that parent control will determine the applicability or availability of the child Checkbox.

Use multiple Checkboxes within the same group when a user may choose one or more items from a group of choices that do not affect the other choices.

## Choosing between Toggle and Checkbox

For some actions, either a Toggle or a Checkbox might work. To decide which control would work better, follow these tips:

- Use a Toggle for binary settings when changes become effective immediately after the user changes them.
- Use a Checkbox when the user has to perform extra steps for changes to be effective. For example, if the user must click a "Submit", "Next", "Ok" button to apply changes, use a Checkbox.
