TextField is accessible if these considerations are followed:

- Make sure the TextField can be used with a mouse and keyboard or touch when available.
- Make sure the TextField is accessible through a screen reader and other accessibility tools.
- Provide a clear visual notification (change color, fade in a box, flash in an arrow) that the focus has moved to the input field when user click/tap on it.
- Give all inputs a `type` attribute (types include email, tel, text, submit, etc.). When supported by a browser, they improve the experience for everyone.
- For required inputs, include regular expression pattern information, or even max-length of characters in the input attributes, which many screen readers can understand.
- Associate the label with text field using `aria-label` or `aria-labelledby` so that screen readers could read its label as soon it gets the focus.
- Use `aria-describedby` to make screen reader announce extra instructions, such as character limits or allowed characters etc.
- When a text field has a character limit, announce the current character count using `aria-describedby`, and notify screen readers if character limit is reached using `aria-live` property.
- Use HTML 5.2 autocomplete attribute to define purpose of input and to make it available to be machine interpreted. This would help in auto-filling the stored data, and in some cases replace textual labels with icons to make things easier for cognitive and motor impaired users.
- Sizing input fields between `32px` and `40px` in height makes your field finger-friendly and not very large at the same time.
