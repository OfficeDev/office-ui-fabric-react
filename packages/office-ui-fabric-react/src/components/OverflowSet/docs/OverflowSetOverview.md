The OverflowSet is a flexible container component that is useful for displaying a primary set of content with additional content in an overflow callout. Note that the example below is only an example of how to render the component, not a specific use case.

### Accessibility

If you used as a menu, you will need to add to the OverflowSet `role="menubar"`, or `role="menu"` for `vertical` menus, and add proper aria roles to each rendered item (`menuitem`, `menuitemcheckbox`, `menuitemradio`)
