Label is accessible if these considerations are followed:

- Makes sure the label is associated with the respective control either using `<label for="id">` or using `aria-label`, as it helps assistive technologies refer to correct elements.

- Use `aria-describedby` property to provide complementary information in addition to the label. It will get announced after label and role of the control.
