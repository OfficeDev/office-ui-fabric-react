- Do use ChoiceGroup when there are 2-7 options, if you have enough screen space, and the options are important. Otherwise, use a Checkbox or Dropdown list.
- Do use on wizard pages to make the alternatives clear, even if a Checkbox is otherwise acceptable.
- Do list the options in a logical order. This could include: "Most likely to be selected to least", "Simplest operation to most complex", or "Least risk to most." Alphabetical ordering is not recommended because it is language dependent and therefore not localizable.
- Do add another option to use if none of the avaible options are a valid choice. This could include "None" or "Does not apply".
- Do select the safest (to prevent loss of data or system access) and most secure and private option as the default. If safety and security aren't factors, select the most likely or convenient option.
- Do align radio buttons vertically instead of horizontally, if possible. Horizontal alignment is harder to read and localize.
