- Don't use ChoiceGroup when the options are numbers that have fixed steps, like 10, 20, 30. Use a Slider component instead.
- Don't use if there are more than 7 options, use a Dropdown instead.
- Don't nest ChoiceGroup with other ChoiceGroups or CheckBoxes. If possible, keep all the options at the same level.
