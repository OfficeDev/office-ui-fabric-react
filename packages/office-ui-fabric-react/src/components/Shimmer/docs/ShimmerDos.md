- Do use Shimmer to help ease a UI transition when we know the service will potentially take a longer amount of time to retrieve the data.
- Do provide widths for each of the Shimmer elements you used to build a skeleton layout looking as close as possible to real content it is replacing.
- Do use `isDataLoaded` prop to trigger the transition once we have the data from the service. The Shimmer UI should Fade out while the real UI Fades In.
- Do use Shimmer if you know the UI loading time is longer than 1 second.
- Do provide an ETA as quickly as possible to help the user understand that the system isnâ€™t broken if the delay is longer than 10 seconds.
- Do provide Shimmer designs for the breakpoints that your experience is supported in.
