### Layout

- When possible, try a non-blocking dialog box before resorting to a blocking dialog.
- Don't use more than three buttons.
- Validate that people’s entries are acceptable before closing the dialog box. Show an inline validation error near the field they must correct.
- Dialog boxes consist of a header, body, and footer.

#### Header

- Locks to the top of the dialog.
- Includes a Close button in the top-right corner.
- May include an icon to the left of the title.

#### Footer

- Includes one primary button. A secondary button is optional.
- Lock buttons to the bottom of the dialog.

#### Width

- Maximum is 340 pixels.
- Minimum is 288 pixels.

#### Height

- Maximum is 340 pixels.
- Minimum is 172 pixels.

### Content

#### Title

- This mandatory content should explain the main information in a clear, concise, and specific statement or question. For example, “Delete this file?” instead of “Are you sure?”
- The title shouldn’t be a description of the body content. For example, don’t use “Error” as a title. Instead, use an informative statement like “Your session ended.”
- Keep the title as concise as possible.
- Don’t use periods at the end of titles.
- Use sentence-style capitalization—only capitalize the first word. For more info, see [Capitalization](https://docs.microsoft.com/style-guide/capitalization) in the Microsoft Writing Style Guide.

#### Body copy (Optional)

- Use the optional body content area for additional info or instructions, if needed. Only include information needed to help people make a decision.
- Don't restate the title in the body.
- Use actionable language, with the most important information at the beginning.
- Use ending punctuation on sentences.

#### Button labels

- Write button labels that are specific responses to the main information in the title. The title “Delete this file?” could have buttons labeled “Delete” and “Cancel.”
- Be concise. Limit labels to one or two words. Usually a single verb is best. Include a noun if there is any room for interpretation about what the verb means. For example, “Delete” or “Delete file.”
