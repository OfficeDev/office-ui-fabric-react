- Do use Dialogs for quick, actionable interactions, such as making a choice or needing the user to provide information.
- Do use when possible, non-blocking Dialog before resorting to a blocking Dialog.
- Do include information needed to help users make a decision.
- Do reflect avaible actions for the button text. (e.g. save, delete)
- Do validate that the user's entries are acceptable before the Dialog is closed. An inline validation error should be shown near the field they need to correct.
