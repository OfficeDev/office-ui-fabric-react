- Don’t overuse Dialog. Too many can be seen as an interrupting workflow.
- Don't use "Are you sure?" confirmation Dialogs unless the user is making an irreversible or destructive choice.
- Don't use a blocking Dialog unless necessary as they can be disruptive.
- Don’t have long sentences or complicated choices.
- Don't use generic button labels like "Ok."
- Don't dismiss the Dialog if underlying problem is not fixed. Don't put the user back into a broken/error state.
- Don't provide the user with more than 3 buttons.
