- Use a ComboBox when there are multiple choices that can be collapsed under one title, if thier is a long list, or when space is constrained.
- Use shortened statements or words.
- Use a ComboBox when the selected option is more important than the alternatives (in contrast to radio buttons where all the choices are visible putting more emphasis on the other options).
