- Use a Slider when you want your users to be able to set defined values (such as volume or brightness).
- Include a label prop indicating a title for your slider.
- Use step points (or tick marks) if you donâ€™t want the Slider to allow arbitrary values between min and max.
- Use a Slider when the user would benefit from instant feedback on the effect of setting changes.
