# @fluentui/common-styles

**Common style definitions for [Fluent UI React](https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/fluentui)**

These are not production-ready components and **should never be used in product**. This space is useful for testing new components whose APIs might change before final release.

To import common styles files into a .scss file (replace `<fileName>` with the desired file; e.g. `common`, `focusBorder`, etc.):

```scss
@import '~@fluentui/common-styles/src/<fileName>';
```
