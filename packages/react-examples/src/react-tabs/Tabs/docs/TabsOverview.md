The Tabs control and related tabs pattern are used for navigating frequently accessed, distinct content categories. Tabs allow for navigation between two or more content views and relies on text headers to articulate the different sections of content.

- Tapping on a tab item header navigates to that header's section content.

Tabs are a visual variant of Tabs that use a combination of icons and text or just icons to articulate section content.
