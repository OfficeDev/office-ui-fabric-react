Fabric includes 9 theme colors, 14 neutral colors, and 24 accent colors. In Fabric React, these are all within the `theme.palette` object. In Fabric Core, each has helper classes for text, background, border, and hover states. When selecting colors, refer to the [color accessibility guidance (PDF)](https://static2.sharepointonline.com/files/fabric/fabric-website/files/coloraccessibility_29sep2016.pdf) to ensure that your text can be ready by everyone. If you need to customize your theme, see the [Theme Designer](https://aka.ms/themedesigner).
