Office brand icons come in predefined dimensions at 16px, 20px, 32px, 40px, 48px, 64px, and 96px. Although you may overwrite icon sizes with your custom styles, we recommend using our icons at the predefined sizes so the images appear as intended. Fabric includes custom media queries that will display our PNG brand icons in a different resolution depending on the device's pixel density. See the code sample below for an example:

To use the Office and Office 365 multicolor brand icons, select the format and size that best meets your needs. Be sure to use the right resolution for the pixel density of the screen youâ€™re targeting. The following code shows you how to specify a product icon by extension, item type, icon size, and image type using Fabric's `<Icon>` component:

```jsx
// Sample code for displaying an Word 96x96px Icon
<div class="ms-BrandIcon--icon96 ms-BrandIcon--word" />
```
