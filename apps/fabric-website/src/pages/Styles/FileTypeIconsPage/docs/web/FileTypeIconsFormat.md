Multicolor file type icons look best at 16x16, 48x48, and 96x96 px sizes in the UI of Microsoft products. Fabric provides these icons in both SVG and PNG formats. SVGs are more versatile but are not supported by all browsers but since they are vectors, you can resize them more easily. PNGs are supported by most browsers, but require many sizes to remain visually crisp.

Both PNGs and SVGs come in 16x16, 20x20, 32x32, 40x40, 48x48, 64x64 and 96x96 pixel sizes. Where possible, use the default sizes to prevent artifacts and split pixels for PNGs. Otherwise, use the size that most closely maps to what you need for your experience for the best quality.
