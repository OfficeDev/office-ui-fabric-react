Fluent UI React Native is an [open-source](https://github.com/microsoft/fluentui-react-native) library built using of JavaScript and [React Native components](https://microsoft.github.io/react-native-windows/), and can be used to build Fluent experiences across platforms. It contains information about colors and typography, as well as custom controls and customizations for platform controls, all from the official Fluent design language used in Microsoft 365 products.

### Controls

Fluent UI React Native includes an expanding library of controls written in JavaScript. These controls implement the Fluent Design language and provide consistency across Microsoft experiences.

Documentation for the controls is a work in progress. Some controls can be found in the <a href="#/controls/crossplatform">Controls section</a> of the site.

### Start developing

Setup instructions and more information can be found in [the library's readme](https://github.com/microsoft/fluentui-react-native/blob/master/README.md).
