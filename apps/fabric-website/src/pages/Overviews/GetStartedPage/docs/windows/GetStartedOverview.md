Fluent experiences on Windows can be built using the following technologies:

### WinUI 3

WinUI is a user interface layer that contains native controls and styles for building Windows apps. It embodies Fluent Design, giving each Windows app the polished feel that customers expect.

To build Fluent experiences on Windows using native frameworks, please see our [WinUI documentation](https://microsoft.github.io/microsoft-ui-xaml/).

### Fluent UI React Native

Fluent UI React Native is an [open-source](https://github.com/microsoft/fluentui-react-native) library built using of JavaScript and [React Native components](https://microsoft.github.io/react-native-windows/), and can be used to build Fluent experiences for Windows and across other platforms. It contains information about colors and typography, as well as custom controls and customizations for platform controls, all from the official Fluent design language used in Microsoft 365 products.

To build Fluent experiences on Windows using cross-platform frameworks, please see our [Cross-platform Get started page](#/get-started/crossplatform).
