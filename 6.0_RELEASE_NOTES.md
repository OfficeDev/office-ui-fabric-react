# Office UI Fabric React 6.0

Welcome to the 6.0 release of Office UI Fabric React. In version 6.0,
*(placeholder: introduce React 16 and Webpack changes))*.

Because we wanted to ..., we've tried to keep the number of breaking changes
to a minimal. *(placeholder: talk about deprecated vars cleanup in a future
release)*.

##  Webpack tree shaking!

We are excited to announce officially supporting tree shaking. This means that
assuming you use Webpack 4 or above, you can now import things directly from the
`office-ui-fabric-react` package without memorizing top level imports. Webpack
will tree shake out everything you don't use, which creates much smaller bundles!

In order to make tree shaking work, webpack must consume ES6 modules. And since
current Fabric consumers use `/lib/` imports, we needed to adjust the output folders
within the repo:

`/lib/` - ES6 modules (was commonjs). The `/lib-es2015` folder no longer exists, so
make sure to clean up aliases if you were using them.

`/lib-commonjs` - If you refer to fabric components in unit tests via Jest, you
may need to alias the `/lib/` imports to to `/lib-commonjs`. Or use Babel.

Note: To resolve commonjs modules in Jest, you can use this config blurb in your
`jest.config.js`:

```js
  moduleNameMapper: {
    'office-ui-fabric-react/lib/': 'office-ui-fabric-react/lib-commonjs/'
  },
```

`lib-amd` - AMD modules. If you still need AMD, it is important to note another
subtlety: when we import one package from another, we must import from package
based imports (e.g. `import {...} from '@uifabric/utilities'`) rather than file
based imports (`import {...} from '@uifabric/utilities/lib/index'`.) This allows
Webpack to consume the `module` entry in package.json, and node.js to consume the
`main` entry for resolving where the corresponding consumable modules are.

## Rewritten CommandBar

The CommandBar component is one of the most popular components in Fabric but
has long suffered from bloat and rigidity. The complex resizing logic used to
move surplus items into the overflow menu was customized to the component
making it impossible to reuse, and overriding the styles and functionality of
the menu items was difficult and cumbersome.

Therefore, CommandBar has been completely rewritten from top to bottom using
newer, modular components like OverflowSet, ResizeGroup and CommandBarButton.
This makes it easier to customize and theme with only minor breaking interface
changes.

## Breaking changes
* Moved experimental Command Bar into release.
* Selection utility: getSelectedIndices is now a mandatory member of the `ISelection` interface.
* CommandBar: Interface improvements.
* ContextualMenu: Remove onMenuDismssed from props.
* Toggle: Interface improvements.
* Label: Interface improvements.

## Other fixes and changes
* DetailsList: fieldName is now an optional field of IColumn.
* BaseButton: Make adjustment so that customclass names has precedence.
* CommandBar: Supports custom styling and button aliasing.
* CommandBar: Add aria label and change to single tab stop.
* CommandBarButton: Fixed high contrast hover state.
* Toggle: Supports custom styling and aliased root.
* Label: Supports custom styling and aliased root.
